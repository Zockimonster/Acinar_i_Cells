# Acinar_i_Cells
The Acinar-i cell subtype is identified with a central position for cell relationship in Tosti L, et al. Single-nucleus and in situ RNA sequencing reveal cell topographies in the human pancreas. Gastroenterology. 2021;160(4):1330–1344.e11. DOI: 10.1053/j.gastro.2020.11.010. 

While facing integration issues for this cell subtype, the expression of established acinar cell marker genes within this subtype, as well as of markers used in the article was examined. The code, used for the analysis of acinar-i cells, related to adult pancreas samples in EGAS00001004653 (https://explore.data.humancellatlas.org/projects/b3938158-4e8d-4fdb-9e13-9e94270dde16/project-matrices), is available in acinar_i_cells.R, showing consistently nearly absent acinar gene expression levels for acinar-i cells regarding established acinar cell markers:
